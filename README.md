To address the challenges in accurately diagnosing skin diseases, we propose a deep learning-based solution that employs a convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture in conjunction with the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model. Our approach involves fine-tuning MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient CNN model,
with the HAM10000 dataset to classify different skin lesions. The HAM10000 dataset is an extensive collection of dermatoscopic images representing various skin
conditions, providing a solid foundation for training a robust and reliable model.
